I was just thinking that I have to write an article on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the fantastic images from the HiRISE camera onboard. So I checked out  the [HiRISE website](http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/) and [Universe Today](http://www.universetoday.com/) only to be blown away by the images that are on offer.

Firstly this older image of Victoria Crater. This is an oblique view of Victoria, the crater that MER rover Opportunity studied for over a year. Here, the image has been rotated so that we are looking east, with MRO pointed 22 degrees east of straight down, so it is comparable to a view from an airplane window. Some of the rover tracks are still visible to the north of the crater (left side of the image).

Now the rest of the images I'm about to share with you are from the latest image releases from HiRISE site this month.
