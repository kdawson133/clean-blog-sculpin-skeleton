This is a small collection of the best images ever taken of galaxies.

This is a fantastic image of a classic spiral galaxy, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. This image, almost taken face-on, shows the typical structure of a large spiral galaxy like our Milky Way.

This is probably one of my favourite Galaxies M31 also known as the Andromeda Galaxy. For those interested Andromeda is on a collision course with the Milky Way! Don't worry the inevitable collision will not occur during our life time but in about 10 billion years.

Well here is an image of Centaurus A located in the constellation of Centaurus. This just happens to be the strongest radio source in the constellation hence the 'A'. You can probably make out the huge jets of material being flung more than 13,000 light years from the galaxy's centre.
