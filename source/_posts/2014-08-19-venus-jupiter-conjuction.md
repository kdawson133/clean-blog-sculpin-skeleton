The closest planetary conjunction of the year has graced our skies this morning, and astrophotographers were out in force to marvel at it's beauty. The pair were just 11.9â€™ apart, less than half the diameter of a Full Moon. Also joining the view was M44, the Beehive Cluster. This gorgeous shot is from Queensland, Australia by one of our longtime favourite astrophotographers, [Joseph Brimacombe](https://www.flickr.com/photos/43846774@N02/).
